We've already included it in our bundle/ folder so its already enabled. Try opening up a python file and typing 'def<tab>'. It should stub out a method definition for you and allow you to tab through and fill out the arguments, doc string, etc.

I also like to create my own snippets folder to put in some custom snippets:

$ mkdir ~/.vim/snippets
$ vim ~/.vim/snippets/python.snippets
Put this in the file:

snippet pdb
    import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
Now you can type pdb<tab> and it'll insert your breakpoint!
